# Mission-to-Mars: Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Overview: 
Update the web app previously created in this module to showcase facts, images, and the latest new about the planet Mars.

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, then store the scraped data on a Mongo database. Next, use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Results:

Deliverable 1 & 2:

- I was able to scrape the full-resolution Mars hemisphere images and titles, along with updating the Web App with the like.

Deliverable 3:

- I confirmed that the webpage was mobile-responsive.
- I used two Bootstrap 3 components to update the style of the webpage.  I changed the "Web Scraping" button color to purple, and the background of the container to a light aqua color.  In addition, I changed the container color for the "Mars Facts" to a light beige color.  
Note: I did attempt to change the table structure using Bootstrap to edit the table style to "table table-dark" (from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/), but I did not get the results I expected.
